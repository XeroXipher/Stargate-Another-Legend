# Stargate-Another-Legend
In the name of the Father,<br>
And the Son,<br>
And the Holy Spirit,<br>
Hallow be thy name.<br>
Thy Kingdom come,<br>
Thy will be done,<br>
On Earth as it is in Heaven.<br>
Give us this day,<br>
Our Daily bread,<br>
And forgive us for our trespasses,<br>
As we forgive those,<br>
Who trespass against us,<br>
And Deliver us from Evil,<br>
Amen.<br>

"Dear Lord God, I have wished for an Alternate Reality in the form of a Stargate Video Game, and I truly believe we're coming close to receiving my wish, I hope you can help to make this Dream a Reality, Amen."
